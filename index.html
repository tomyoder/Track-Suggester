      <p class="par1"><span class="bold">The first question is whether you're more interested in working with design or structure.</span> Would you rather craft how a website looks and "feels" to use, or make the nuts-and bolts structure that makes the whole site function? </p>

    <div id="large">
      <p class="par4"><span class="bold">Many programming students aspire to work for a large company</span>, in part because of a perceived status, stability, and an expectation of high pay. Working for a large company can be very rewarding, though one can be "lost in the crowd".
      Large employers hiring programmers also include Government and Utilities.</p>

      <h1>C#</h1>
      <p class="Csharp"><span class="bold">C# is in heavy use at Microsoft,</span> and many other major software employers. C# is intended to be a modern object-oriented programming language. C# is used for applications in both hosted and embedded systems, making it useful pretty much anywhere, but most likely in apps intended for production on a mass scale.</p>

      <h1>Java</h1>
      <p class="java"><span class="bold">The programming language Java,</span> originally designed for interactive television, has become one of the most widely used languages in the field. Java aspires to an idea know as WORA, or "write once, run anywhere". WORA means Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java is in use by large firms but is also renowned for its flexibility, open-sourced accessibility, and the fact that it is not certified to an ECMA or ISO/IEC standard but is subject to Java Community Process. </p>
    </div>

    <div id="medium">
      <p class="par4"><span class="bold">Medium sized companies offer much of the benefits of larger ones</span> while being generally more flexible and dynamic. More recognition is available to individual employees, and strict adherence to specialization is lessened. Language needs begin to emphasize that same flexibility and adaptibility. Speed in prototyping apps is more of a priority than focusing on the requirements of mass production.</p>

      <h1>PHP</h1>
      <p class="php"><span class="bold">PHP is a server-side scripting language intended for web development.</span> It's been said that 80% of the web is running on PHP. Like Java, PHP has no formal specification. PHP is most useful to websites dependent on access to databases in order to function, and not quite as dynamic in user interaction as JavaScript, the most comparable browser-side scripting language. PHP is also used as a general-purpose programming language.</p>

    <div id="small">
      <p class="par4"><span class="bold">Small companies can be best for people who want a range of different activities within their job title.</span> Small companies can adapt more quickly to changing conditions than large ones, and the information industry changes faster than any other. Small companies offer individuals a real ability to point to a product and say "I built that."</p>

      <p class="par4"><span class="bold">When you work for yourself, you can work for anybody on your own terms.</span> Freelancers often tend to specialize, but this specialization might rely on any language or a number of languages. Here is a list of prominent languages:</p>
